# KBTU STUDENT Life Team 15 JAM


## About game
**Study Body** is a game in which the player can feel like a KBTU student. When entering the game, the player starts at his home and he will have three unique indicators (intelligence, Health, Happiness), which in the future will be needed in order not to retake. Intelligence, health and happiness scales can be earned and extended by playing internal mini-games and participating in special events. For example, if a player wants to improve their health, they should go to the gym and do body exercises such as pull-ups, dumbbell exercises or boxing. You can also go to the theater and also find reason and happiness. And to get into these mini-games, the player can go to the map and select the location he needs. And an important feature of the game is that all the locations were taken from real life, that is, all these buildings exist in real life in the city of Almaty. The game was made as similar as possible to real life. The player's characteristics will change as realistically as possible depending on the player's action. As the game progresses, the player can encounter unique events that can also affect the player's character. The timeline of the game is divided into three. That is, a player cannot play one game endlessly and earn points. But there is one special "Casino" location where the player can play endlessly. But if the player's Happiness is zero, then the game stops
For example, Mr. Kelgenbayev can send an email and invite you to a hackathon, or a character may get sick. The game has five different endings. And one of them is a secret one. And in order to see this ending, the player must play the game as hard as possible.
